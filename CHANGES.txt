3.5.1 (2008-10-10)
------------------

- Provide a work around for a mechanize/urllib2 bug on Python 2.6
  missing 'timeout' attribute on 'Request' base class.

- Provide a work around for a mechanize/urllib2 bug in creating request
  objects that won't handle fragment URLs correctly.

3.5.0 (2008-03-30)
------------------

- Added a zope.testbrowser.testing.Browser.post method that allows
  tests to supply a body and a content type.  This is handy for
  testing Ajax requests with non-form input (e.g. JSON).

- Remove vendor import of mechanize.

- Fix bug that caused HTTP exception tracebacks to differ between version 3.4.0
  and 3.4.1.

- Workaround for bug in Python Cookie.SimpleCookie when handling unicode
  strings.

- Fix bug introduced in 3.4.1 that created incompatible tracebacks in doctests.
  This necessitated adding a patched mechanize to the source tree; patches have
  been sent to the mechanize project.

- Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/149517 by adding zope.interface and
  zope.schema as real dependencies

- Fix browser.getLink documentation that was not updated since the last API
  modification.

- Move tests for fixed bugs to a separate file.

- Removed non-functional and undocumented code intended to help test servers
  using virtual hosting.


3.4.2 (2007-10-31)
------------------

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.

3.4.0 (2007-06-04)
------------------

* Added the ability to suppress raising exceptions on HTTP errors
