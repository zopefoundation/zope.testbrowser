3.9.0 (2010-05-17)
------------------

- LP #568806: Update dependency ``mechanize >= 0.2.0``, which now includes
  the ``ClientForm`` APIs.  Remove use of ``urllib2`` APIs (incompatible
  with ``mechanize 0.2.0``) in favor of ``mechanize`` equivalents.
  Thanks to John J. Lee for the patch.

- Use stdlib ``doctest`` module, instead of ``zope.testing.doctest``.


3.8.1 (2010-04-19)
------------------

- Pinned dependency on mechanize to prevent use of the upcoming
  0.2.0 release before we have time to adjust to its API changes.

- LP #98396:  testbrowser resolves relative URLs incorrectly.


3.8.0 (2010-03-05)
------------------

- Added ``follow`` convenience method which gets and follows a link.


3.7.0 (2009-12-17)
------------------

- Moved zope.app.testing dependency into the scope of the PublisherConnection
  class. Zope2 specifies its own PublisherConnection which isn't dependent on
  zope.app.testing.

- Fixed LP #419119: return None when the browser has no contents instead of
  raising an exception.


3.7.0a1 (2009-08-29)
--------------------

- Remove dependency on zope.app.publisher in favor of zope.browserpage,
  zope.browserresource and zope.ptresource.

- Remove dependencies on zope.app.principalannotation and zope.securitypolicy
  by using the simple PermissiveSecurityPolicy. We aren't testing security
  in our tests.

- Replaced the testing dependency on zope.app.zcmlfiles with explicit
  dependencies of a minimal set of packages.

- Remove unneeded zope.app.authentication from ftesting.zcml.

- Test dependency on zope.securitypolicy instead of its app variant.


3.6.0a2 (2009-01-31)
--------------------

- Test dependency on zope.site.folder instead of zope.app.folder.

- Remove useless test dependency in zope.app.component.


3.6.0a1 (2009-01-08)
--------------------

- Author e-mail to zope-dev rather than zope3-dev.

- New lines are no longer stripped in XML and HTML code contained in a
  textarea; fix requires ClientForm >= 0.2.10 (LP #268139).

- Added ``cookies`` attribute to browser for easy manipulation of browser
  cookies.  See brief example in main documentation, plus new ``cookies.txt``
  documentation.


3.5.1 (2008-10-10)
------------------

- Provide a work around for a mechanize/urllib2 bug on Python 2.6
  missing 'timeout' attribute on 'Request' base class.

- Provide a work around for a mechanize/urllib2 bug in creating request
  objects that won't handle fragment URLs correctly.


3.5.0 (2008-03-30)
------------------

- Added a zope.testbrowser.testing.Browser.post method that allows
  tests to supply a body and a content type.  This is handy for
  testing Ajax requests with non-form input (e.g. JSON).

- Remove vendor import of mechanize.

- Fix bug that caused HTTP exception tracebacks to differ between version 3.4.0
  and 3.4.1.

- Workaround for bug in Python Cookie.SimpleCookie when handling unicode
  strings.

- Fix bug introduced in 3.4.1 that created incompatible tracebacks in doctests.
  This necessitated adding a patched mechanize to the source tree; patches have
  been sent to the mechanize project.

- Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/149517 by adding zope.interface and
  zope.schema as real dependencies

- Fix browser.getLink documentation that was not updated since the last API
  modification.

- Move tests for fixed bugs to a separate file.

- Removed non-functional and undocumented code intended to help test servers
  using virtual hosting.


3.4.2 (2007-10-31)
------------------

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.


3.4.1 (2007-09-01)
------------------

* Updated to mechanize 0.1.7b and ClientForm 0.2.7.  These are now
  pulled in via egg dependencies.

* ``zope.testbrowser`` now works on Python 2.5.


3.4.0 (2007-06-04)
------------------

* Added the ability to suppress raising exceptions on HTTP errors
  (``raiseHttpErrors`` attribute).

* Made the tests more resilient to HTTP header formatting changes with
  the REnormalizer.


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.testbrowser
from Zope 3.4.0a1
